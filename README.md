# 🛠️ E-Com Floor-Mats Kit

A collection of **templates and resources** I use for my car-mats e-commerce business.  
It includes invoice samples, CN22 / CN23 customs forms, packaging notes, and shipping-weight calculators.

---

### 📂 Structure
- **/invoices** — invoice & packing-list templates (PDF/DOCX)  
- **/shipping** — CN22/CN23 customs forms and label examples  
- **/guides** — notes on declared value, packaging and delivery to different countries  

---

### 🚀 Goals
- Keep all export paperwork templates in one place  
- Help other small e-commerce sellers avoid mistakes with customs forms  
- Gradually automate routine documents
